# Chest X-Ray Disease Detection App

Welcome to the Chest X-Ray Based Detection App!  
This project uses a deep learning model trained on Chest X-Ray images to detect three conditions:

- COVID-19
- NORMAL (Healthy)
- PNEUMONIA

**Live Demo:** [Click here to try the Web App](https://chest-xray-based-detection.streamlit.app/)

## About the Project

This project is built using:

- A custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) achieving 96.35% test accuracy.
- Preprocessing with VGG16 style normalization.
- Mixup data augmentation and various regularization techniques to ensure strong generalization.
- Deployed using Streamlit Cloud for real-time user interaction.

The goal is to provide a simple tool where users can upload Chest X-Ray images and quickly get predictions about potential diseases.
